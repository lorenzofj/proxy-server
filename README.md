# Proxy Server

I'm learning what is a proxy server, what is it for, what are the pros and cons of and how to create one.

I've read articles and watched videos:

2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPIukqXe5w
3. https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/proxy-server

In the middle of the third link I got stuck with a lot of terms I've usually heard but I really didn't knew them in depth like HTTP methods, CORS, COP. So I stopped reading that and started learning these concepts.

I'm currently learning the basics of Node.js watching and reading these sources:
